# Running locally:

This application can be run simply by opening 'index.html' in your browser. It will by default, access the public back-end running on heroku.

If you want the application to run entirely on your machine, you'll need the back-end [here](https://github.com/nwdunlap17/minidnd-backend).

Once the backend is running, go to 'src/index.js' and change 'BASE_URL' to point at the address of the back-end you have created.
